## What are GitLab CI/CD Components?

GitLab CI/CD Components are reusable, shareable pipeline configuration snippets that can be included in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` files. They enable you to:

- **Modularize** your CI/CD pipelines
- **Share** common patterns across projects
- **Standardize** workflows across teams
- **Simplify** pipeline configuration

## Documentation Structure

This documentation follows the **Diátaxis framework**, organizing content into four distinct categories:
