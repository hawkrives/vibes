# Explanation

**Understanding-oriented discussions that clarify and illuminate GitLab CI/CD components**

Explanation documentation helps you understand the bigger picture. It discusses topics at a higher level, exploring concepts, design decisions, and the "why" behind components.

## What's in Explanation

This section contains:

- Conceptual overviews
- Design decisions and rationale
- Architecture discussions
- Best practices and patterns
- Security considerations
- Trade-offs and alternatives

## Explanation Topics

### [Component Architecture](/explanation/architecture)
How components work internally, their structure, and design principles.

### [Component Catalog](/explanation/catalog)
Understanding GitLab's CI/CD Catalog and component discovery.

### [Best Practices](/explanation/best-practices)
Proven patterns and recommendations for creating effective components.

### [Security Considerations](/explanation/security)
